#Flappy Bird With Q-learning

This is a flappy bird game with an AI playing it.

The project is inspired by the work done by [SarvagyaVaish](https://github.com/SarvagyaVaish/FlappyBirdRL), and the game engine [Omega500](https://github.com/mrspeaker/Omega500) is kept used in this project.

To start the server, change your directory to the root folder of this project, then

```
$python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

After this, you can train your bird in your browser.

This is just a toy project, which helps me to learn q-learning a lot.
